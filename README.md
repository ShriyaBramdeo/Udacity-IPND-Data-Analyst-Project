####Project Description:

From Udacity: "For the final project, you will conduct your own data analysis and create a file to share that documents your findings. You should start by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming what questions you could answer using it. Then you should use Pandas and NumPy to answer the questions you are most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. You will not be required to use statistics or machine learning to complete this project, but you should make it clear in your communications that your findings are tentative. This project is open-ended in that we are not looking for one right answer."

For this project, I chose to analyse the Baseball Data (http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/)

From Udacity: "A data set containing complete batting and pitching statistics from 1871 to 2015, plus fielding statistics, standings, team stats, managerial records, post-season data, and more. This dataset contains many files, but you can choose to analyze only the one(s) you are most interested in."

####Installation:

The file is a Jupyter Notebook (http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) that also utilizes Python 2.7, Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, and matplotlib.

####Credits:

A fair amount of Googling was required as I completed this project and links to the pages that provided assistance can be found within the Jupyter Notebook.
